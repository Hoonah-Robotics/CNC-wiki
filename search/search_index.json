CAD by design \u00b6 \"design or draw from your imagination and wishes\" What is this step? \u00b6 CAD stands for Computer-Aided Design . This is the starting point for any project. It's where you use computer software to create a 2D or 3D digital model of your idea. Think of it as a high-tech drawing board. For our CNC machine, we typically start with a 2D \"vector\" drawing, which is like a digital connect-the-dots outline that the machine can follow. Key Vocabulary \u00b6 CAD (Computer-Aided Design): Using software to create digital drawings or models. Vector (or SVG): A type of graphic that uses mathematical lines and curves to create an image. This is perfect for CNC because the machine can follow these lines. This is different from a \"pixel\" image (like a photo or .jpg) which has no clear path for a machine to follow. Export: Saving your work in a specific file format. We will export our designs to SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) . Workflow Steps \u00b6 Imagine: Decide what you want to make. A sign? A keychain? A wall hanging? For your first CNC project start with a basic design. Design knowing the limits of CNC We will be using a standard 1/8\" (3.175mm) straight end mill to cut. You cannot cut a channel narrower than 1/8\"! Also, a rotating tool cannot cut a perfectly sharp internal 90\u00b0 corner. The finest internal corner will have a 1/16\" radius. Compare this to 3d Printers that can extrude lines to 0.1mm width! Choose Your Software: We recommend one of these two options: Autodesk Tinkercad : A very easy to use, free, browser-based tool. While it's known for 3D, you can easily create 2D shapes, text, or export the \"bottom\" of a 3D design as an SVG. Adobe Illustrator : A professional tool (available at Alaska STEAM hub) that is excellent for creating detailed vector art, text, and logos. There are dozens of other good design software that also can be used. They must be able to export vectors in SVG format. Painting and photo editing software like Photoshop will not work! Canva only allows downloading your design as an SVG file with the Pro subscription. The resulting file may require cleanup in the software listed above especially if you used complex shapes or text since it is the Canva AI translating your design into SVG. Create Your Design: Draw your shapes. In Tinkercad the Extrude Sketch and Scribble tools are the most flexible. Any extruded basic shape or text with a flat top and bottom will also work. Box , Polygon , Star , Heart , Script are all good shapes. But a Pyramid with a pointed top will export to SVG as a square. Import > SVG images work, and you can convert the image to an outline using Fill Mode: Outer Line from the shape attributes panel. A helpful video shows this: Use the Tinkercad SVG Tool to Create Laser & CNC Designs in Minutes! Ensure all your lines are \"closed polygons\" (no gaps, no tails). In Adobe Illustrator text needs to be \"outlined\" (converted from a text-font into a shape) using the Type > Create Outlines command. Export to SVG: For Tinkercad make sure your design is positioned flat on the workplane at z = 0 Go to File > Export and choose SVG as the file type. This .svg file is what you will use in the next step (CAM).","title":"1.

CAM the carver \u00b6 \"turn your drawing into a toolpath for carving\" What is this step? \u00b6 CAM stands for Computer-Aided Manufacturing . This step is the \"translator.\" It takes your CAD drawing (the .svg file) and translates it into instructions for the CNC machine. You use CAM software (we use Easel ) to tell the machine how to carve your design. You will define what kind of cutting bit you're using, how deep to cut, and how fast to move. The CAM software then calculates all the specific X, Y, and Z movements, called toolpaths , and exports them as G-Code . Key Vocabulary \u00b6 CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing): Software that turns a design file into machine instructions. Easel: The free, browser-based CAM software we will use. Toolpath: The calculated path the cutting bit will follow to carve your design. You will see this as a blue line in the Easel preview. G-Code: The programming language for CNC machines. It's just a long list of coordinates and commands, like G1 X50 Y10 Z-1 . You don't need to write G-Code, the CAM software does it for you! Bit (or End Mill): The cutting tool that goes into the CNC router. They come in many shapes and sizes. Workflow Steps \u00b6 Sign Up for Easel: Go to Easel (easel.inventables.com) and create a free account. Start a New Project: Click \"New Project\" in Easel. Set Material: In the top-right, set your material type (e.g., Softwood, Plywood) and its exact dimensions (Length, Width, and Thickness ). Use Material : Pine , Width : 12 in , Length : 12 in , Width : 0.75 in Set Bit: Tell Easel what bit you are using (e.g., 1/8\" Up-Cut ). This is critical for an accurate cut. Review the Speed and Feed Settings In Automatic Mode Easel will set all the speed and feed settings based on your CNC machine, material, and bit* Below are typical settings for our beginner projects with Softwood and 1/8\" (3.175mm) upcut bit . Check Easel's Cut Settings are very similar, and if not double-check what machine, material, and bit you selected above!

This video is a fantastic guide for all the physical steps of \"Step 3: Control the Machine\" and \"Step 4: CNC the Maker\". Watch it carefully. There are some details we will do differently, so also follow along with our Workflow steps below. ### Key Steps from the Video Here is a breakdown of the key tasks you will perform, with timestamps from the video. Methods to hold down your material (1:20) Your material must not move during a carve. The video shows using clamps (3:30) and the \"blue tape and CA glue\" method. The blue tape & glue method is excellent because it holds the material flat from underneath, so the router can't run into a clamp (7:46). Install your bit (11:15) Make sure the CNC is unplugged or the spindle is off. Insert the bit into the collet (the part that grabs the bit). Make sure you push it in far enough, but do not let the \"flutes\" (the cutting edges) go up inside the collet. Tighten the collet nut securely with the wrenches. Installation of your GRBL CNC machine (13:12) This is the one-time step of installing the \"drivers\" (software) that lets your computer talk to the CNC's controller. This has already been done for you on the CNC-STEAM headless computer the CNC is connected to. Opening UGS software (15:54) The video shows connecting to UGS (Universal Gcode Sender). This is what we will do in our 3. Control the machine step, with a few differences with our CNC-STEAM setup. Setting the zero position correctly (21:00) This is the most critical step. This video shows two methods: The Paper Method: Jog the Z-axis down until a piece of paper under the bit just starts to get stuck. This is Z=0. A Z-Probe: This is a small metal block that automates finding the Z=0. This is what we will use. Always remember to set your X, Y, and Z zero points before you start! Loading and starting the job (25:41) Load your G-Code file into UGS and check the visualizer. Put on your safety glasses. Turn on the spindle. Click Send . Do not walk away. Watch the machine, especially for the first few minutes, to make sure everything is working as expected. Secure your material to the spoilboard by clamp or glue Your material must not move during a carve. 3d printed clamps work well because if the toolhead moves beyond the material, the bit will easily chew up the clamp without breaking. The blue tape & glue method is excellent because it holds the material flat from underneath, so the router can't run into a clamp. Install your Bit (End Mill) The Bit is sharper than a knife! Hold the bit only by the shank and never by the flute. The corner end of the flute is even sharper than a knife! A bit is designed to cut through steel like butter. Make sure the CNC is unplugged or the spindle is off. Insert the bit into the collet (the part that grabs the bit). Make sure you push it in far enough, but do not let the \"flutes\" (the cutting edges) go up inside the collet. Tighten the collet nut securely with the wrenches. Connect to G-code Sender There are two versions depending if the computer is your own personal connected by USB or one from HCS managed by TechOps. Choose your method: I am using my own personal computer connected to the CNC by USB cable... Download and Install Software You will need both Universal Gcode Sender (UGS) software and CH340 USB drivers downloaded and installed to your computer. Note that the HCS computers will be using CNCjs instead of UGS but they are nearly identical so the instructions below should still work fine. CH340 drivers Universal Gcode Sender (UGS) , Platform version. Connect to the CNC: Turn on the FoxAlien Masuter CNC machine. Connect the computer to the CNC using the USB cable. Launch the gcode sender: Open UGS installed on your computer. I am using a Hoonah School's computer managed by TechOps... Connect to the CNC Machine: The CNC-Pro , CNC-3S , or CNC-mini box should be connected by USB to the target CNC machine and to a power supply by microUSB. There should be a linking red light inside the box. CNC-Pro should be powered ON for 15 seconds before the next step. Turn on the CNC machine and wait 10 seconds. Launch CNCjs: From your computer, type in the URL: http://CNC-Pro in the top of Chrome browser window. Do not do a Google Search since Google does not know about our CNC machines!! Establish Connection: In the \"Connection\" window, select the correct Port for the CNC. (It will usually be the only one that appears when you plug in the machine). Set the Baud Rate to 115200 (this is the standard for our machine). Click \"Connect\" (it looks like a plug icon). The status should change to \"Online\". (optional) Type $$ into the Console and the machine should report report its settings. Load G-Code: Go to File > Open and select the .nc or .gcode file you exported from Easel. Watch for any machine errors in the Visualizer! Is the machine doing what we want it to do? Finding machine errors now can head off disasters later! Set Your Zero (Origin): This is the most important part of machine setup. You must tell the machine exactly where your job starts. Use the \"Jog\" buttons in UGS to move the CNC's toolhead: Move the X and Y axes until the tip of the bit is directly over the bottom-left corner of your material. Click the \"Reset X\" and \"Reset Y\" buttons (or Set X=0 , Set Y=0 ). Carefully \"jog\" the Z-axis down until the very tip of the bit is just touching the top surface of your material. (The \"paper method\" is great for this). Click the \"Reset Z\" button ( Set Z=0 ). Your machine now knows its (0, 0, 0) starting point.","title":"3.

There should be a linking red light inside the box. CNC-Pro should be powered ON for 15 seconds before the next step. Turn on the CNC machine and wait 10 seconds. Launch CNCjs: From your computer, type in the URL: http://CNC-Pro in the top of Chrome browser window. Do not do a Google Search since Google does not know about our CNC machines!! Establish Connection: In the \"Connection\" window, select the correct Port for the CNC. (It will usually be the only one that appears when you plug in the machine). Set the Baud Rate to 115200 (this is the standard for our machine). Click \"Connect\" (it looks like a plug icon). The status should change to \"Online\". (optional) Type $$ into the Console and the machine should report report its settings. Load G-Code: Go to File > Open and select the .nc or .gcode file you exported from Easel. Watch for any machine errors in the Visualizer! Is the machine doing what we want it to do? Finding machine errors now can head off disasters later! Set Your Zero (Origin): This is the most important part of machine setup. You must tell the machine exactly where your job starts. Use the \"Jog\" buttons in UGS to move the CNC's toolhead: Move the X and Y axes until the tip of the bit is directly over the bottom-left corner of your material. Click the \"Reset X\" and \"Reset Y\" buttons (or Set X=0 , Set Y=0 ). Carefully \"jog\" the Z-axis down until the very tip of the bit is just touching the top surface of your material. (The \"paper method\" is great for this). Click the \"Reset Z\" button ( Set Z=0 ). Your machine now knows its (0, 0, 0) starting point.","title":"Workflow Steps"},{"location":"credits/","text":"Credit where credit is due \u00b6 \"None of our work is possible without the contributions of many.

A-C \u00b6 Bit (or End Mill) The cutting tool that is inserted into the router. Unlike a drill bit which only cuts down, a CNC bit can cut sideways. They come in many shapes (flat, ball nose, v-bit) and sizes. CAD (Computer-Aided Design) Software used to create digital drawings or models. In our workflow, this is the \"drawing\" step where you create the design (using Tinkercad or Illustrator) before you worry about how to cut it. CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing) Software that takes your design and calculates the \"toolpaths\" for the machine. It figures out how fast to move and where to cut. We use Easel for this step. CNC (Computer Numerical Control) The general term for a machine that is controlled by a computer. It usually refers to the process of using a computer to drive motors that move a tool to shape material. Collet The steel sleeve that holds the bit inside the spindle/router. It works like a clamp: as you tighten the nut, the collet squeezes the bit to hold it tight. D-G \u00b6 Down-cut Bit A specific type of bit where the spiral blades push the chips down into the material. This leaves a very clean top edge, but packs sawdust into the groove. Driver A small piece of software installed on your computer that allows it to talk to the CNC machine's controller via USB. End Mill The technical name for a CNC \"bit.\" Feed Rate The speed at which the machine moves the cutting tool through the material (usually measured in inches per minute or mm/min). G-Code The programming language the CNC machine understands. It is a text file full of coordinates (like G1 X10 Y50 ) that tells the motors exactly where to go. You don't write this; your CAM software creates it for you. H-P \u00b6 Jog / Jogging Manually moving the CNC machine's axes (X, Y, or Z) using the buttons in the controller software. You \"jog\" the machine to move it into position to set your Zero point. Origin (or Home/Zero) The specific point (0, 0, 0) where the X, Y, and Z axes meet. You must set this point on your material before every job so the machine knows where to start. Pass Depth How deep the bit cuts in a single pass. If you need to cut through 1 inch of wood, but your pass depth is 0.1 inches, the machine will make 10 loops to cut all the way through. R-T \u00b6 Raster vs. Vector * Raster: An image made of dots/pixels (like a JPG photo). CNC machines struggle with these. * Vector: An image made of mathematical lines and curves (like an SVG). CNC machines love these because they can just follow the line. Router / Spindle The motor that spins the bit. On our machine, this is the Makita router or the stock spindle provided with the FoxAlien. Spoilboard The disposable board mounted to the base of the CNC machine. It sits under your material so that if you cut all the way through, you damage the cheap spoilboard instead of the metal machine bed. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) The file format we export from our CAD software. It saves the \"vectors\" (lines) that the CAM software needs. Toolpath The actual route the machine will take to cut your design. In Easel, you can see these as blue lines in the 3D preview. Up-cut Bit A bit where the spiral blades pull chips up and out of the cut (like a corkscrew). This clears sawdust well but can fray the top edge of your wood. U-Z \u00b6 UGS (Universal Gcode Sender) The software on the computer that acts as the \"traffic controller.\" It connects to the machine, sends the G-Code instructions, and lets you jog the machine. Workholding The method used to secure your material to the machine bed so it doesn't move. Common methods include clamps, double-sided tape, or the \"tape & glue\" method. X, Y, Z Axes The three directions the machine moves: * X: Left and Right. * Y: Forward and Backward. * Z: Up and Down.","title":"Glossary of Terms"},{"location":"glossary/#cnc-glossary-of-terms","text":"A quick reference guide to the technical terms used in our CNC-STEAM workflow.","title":"CNC Glossary of Terms"},{"location":"glossary/#a-c","text":"Bit (or End Mill) The cutting tool that is inserted into the router.

A lot of commands are Modal meaning they are remembered and applied to subsequent commands. For example, G0 X1 followed by Z5 remembers the G0 Mode and applies it to the Z5. S is modal, remembered from the last command. Two commands in the same modal group cannot be on the same line.","title":"Supported Gcodes"},{"location":"grbl/#parameters","text":"Letter Description X Y Z A Distances or positions on the X Y Z A axes.

After a few woodworking sessions, I noticed sawdust piling up on the rails and screws. It\u2019s not just messy\u2014it can mess with precision. I grab a soft brush and a shop vac every couple of uses to clear it out. The dust-proof control box helps, but don\u2019t skip the frame and moving parts. Five minutes of cleaning saves you headaches later. Check Those Belts and Screws \u00b6 The Masuter Pro\u2019s solid, but things can loosen up over time. I make it a habit to check the belts and screws every month or so. If the belts feel slack, I tighten them just enough\u2014too tight, and you\u2019ll strain the motors. Same goes for screws on the rails and spindle. A quick once-over with a screwdriver keeps everything tight and aligned. Lubricate the Moving Parts \u00b6 Those linear rails and lead screws? They need love. I use a light machine oil\u2014nothing fancy\u2014and dab it on with a cloth every few weeks, especially after heavy use. Wipe off any excess so it doesn\u2019t attract dust. It keeps the motion smooth and quiet, and I\u2019ve noticed less wear since I started doing it. Watch Your Spindle \u00b6 The spindle\u2019s the heart of this thing, so I keep an eye on it. After upgrading to the 500W, I check it for heat or weird noises after long sessions. If it\u2019s running hot, I let it cool down before pushing it again. FoxAlien\u2019s spindles are solid, but don\u2019t overwork them\u2014stick to the recommended duty cycles, and you\u2019ll be golden. Update Your Software \u00b6 This one\u2019s easy to forget, but it matters. A quick download can fix bugs or improve performance. Plus, FoxAlien includes drivers on a flash drive\u2014keep it handy in case you need to reinstall. It\u2019s a small step that keeps the machine humming.

Here's how to fix the most common ones.\" What to do when things go wrong? \u00b6 Your first few carves will probably not be perfect, and that's okay! CNC is a process of learning and tuning. This video from Chris Powell is an excellent resource for the 10 most common issues beginners face. Top 10 Issues and Solutions \u00b6 Here is a list of the problems covered in the video. If you have one of these issues, jump to the timestamp to see the solution. Spindle not starting (in Easel) (1:10) (Note: We use UGS, but this can still be a \"Did you turn it on?\" check!) Why do my bits keep breaking? (2:26) Hint: Your \"feeds and speeds\" (how fast it moves and spins) are likely too aggressive for the bit or material. Missing detail in a design (4:00) Hint: Your bit might be too large for the tiny details you are trying to carve. Machine not connecting to your computer (6:52) Hint: Check your USB cable, your COM port settings in UGS, and your drivers. Axis keep jamming (10:12) Hint: Check for-debris on the rails, loose wires, or mechanical issues. Z depth or depth of cut is wrong (12:42) Hint: You probably set your Z-Zero incorrectly. Redo the \"paper method\" or Z-probe step. Axis going the wrong way or design coming out mirrored (14:48) Hint: This is often a machine setup issue in the GRBL settings. Ask an instructor for help with this. Design not cutting even or depth uneven (18:50) Hint: Your \"spoilboard\" (the board under your material) is not level, or your material is bowed. Material comes loose during a job (20:02) Hint: Your workholding (clamps or tape) failed. You need a better method to hold it down. Job keeps stopping halfway through or losing connection (21:19) Hint: This can be a bad USB cable, or the computer going to sleep.
