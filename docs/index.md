### **Summary of Steps**

Below is a quick summary of the journey. Click any step to jump to the detailed guide.

**[1. CAD by design](cad.md)** The "drawing" phase. We'll use CAD design software to create a digital design of our ideas.

**[2. CAM the carver](cam.md)** The "planning" phase. We'll tell the computer how to carve the drawing, what tool to use, and how fast to go.

**[3. Control the machine](control.md)** The "communication" phase. We'll connect our computer to the CNC machine and send it the instructions.

**[4. CNC the maker](cnc-maker.md)** The "making" phase. We'll set up the machine, secure our material, and watch it carve!
