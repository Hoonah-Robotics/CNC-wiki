### What is this step?

This is it! The "making" part. This page covers the physical setup of the **FoxAlien Masuter Pro** machine. This includes clamping your material to the machine's bed, installing the correct cutting bit, and safely operating the machine.

Your G-Code tells the CNC **what** to do, but this step is **you** setting up the machine for success. Pay close attention to detail here. **Safety is the number one priority.**
