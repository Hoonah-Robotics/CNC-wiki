### What to do when things go wrong?

Your first few carves will probably not be perfect, and that's okay! CNC is a process of learning and tuning. This video from Chris Powell is an excellent resource for the 10 most common issues beginners face.

### Top 10 Issues and Solutions

Here is a list of the problems covered in the video. If you have one of these issues, jump to the timestamp to see the solution.

1.  **Spindle not starting (in Easel) (1:10)**
    * (Note: We use UGS, but this can still be a "Did you turn it on?" check!)

2.  **Why do my bits keep breaking? (2:26)**
    * *Hint: Your "feeds and speeds" (how fast it moves and spins) are likely too aggressive for the bit or material.*

3.  **Missing detail in a design (4:00)**
    * *Hint: Your bit might be too large for the tiny details you are trying to carve.*

4.  **Machine not connecting to your computer (6:52)**
    * *Hint: Check your USB cable, your COM port settings in UGS, and your drivers.*

5.  **Axis keep jamming (10:12)**
    * *Hint: Check for-debris on the rails, loose wires, or mechanical issues.*

6.  **Z depth or depth of cut is wrong (12:42)**
    * *Hint: You probably set your Z-Zero incorrectly. Redo the "paper method" or Z-probe step.*

7.  **Axis going the wrong way or design coming out mirrored (14:48)**
    * *Hint: This is often a machine setup issue in the GRBL settings. Ask an instructor for help with this.*

8.  **Design not cutting even or depth uneven (18:50)**
    * *Hint: Your "spoilboard" (the board under your material) is not level, or your material is bowed.*

9.  **Material comes loose during a job (20:02)**
    * *Hint: Your workholding (clamps or tape) failed. You need a better method to hold it down.*

10. **Job keeps stopping halfway through or losing connection (21:19)**
    * *Hint: This can be a bad USB cable, or the computer going to sleep. Disable your computer's sleep settings!*
