## Maintenance Tips
> "Keeping Your FoxAlien Running Smoothly"

### Clean It Like You Mean It

Dust is your enemy—I learned that the hard way. After a few woodworking sessions, I noticed sawdust piling up on the rails and screws. It’s not just messy—it can mess with precision. I grab a soft brush and a shop vac every couple of uses to clear it out. The dust-proof control box helps, but don’t skip the frame and moving parts. Five minutes of cleaning saves you headaches later.

### Check Those Belts and Screws

The Masuter Pro’s solid, but things can loosen up over time. I make it a habit to check the belts and screws every month or so. If the belts feel slack, I tighten them just enough—too tight, and you’ll strain the motors. Same goes for screws on the rails and spindle. A quick once-over with a screwdriver keeps everything tight and aligned.

### Lubricate the Moving Parts

Those linear rails and lead screws? They need love. I use a light machine oil—nothing fancy—and dab it on with a cloth every few weeks, especially after heavy use. Wipe off any excess so it doesn’t attract dust. It keeps the motion smooth and quiet, and I’ve noticed less wear since I started doing it.

### Watch Your Spindle

The spindle’s the heart of this thing, so I keep an eye on it. After upgrading to the 500W, I check it for heat or weird noises after long sessions. If it’s running hot, I let it cool down before pushing it again. FoxAlien’s spindles are solid, but don’t overwork them—stick to the recommended duty cycles, and you’ll be golden.

### Update Your Software

This one’s easy to forget, but it matters. A quick download can fix bugs or improve performance. Plus, FoxAlien includes drivers on a flash drive—keep it handy in case you need to reinstall. It’s a small step that keeps the machine humming.
